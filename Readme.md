# Data Structures And Algorithms - Kotlin

Common Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

## About

I'm following the [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/) Udemy course as a first step in improving my knowledge of CS fundamentals. I've taken many DSA courses in the past; what I especially like about this course in particular, is how the teacher encourages students to build each data structure by themselves. Though the instructor uses `Javascript` when showing their implementation, each concept is taught at a high level and provides the student with enough knowledge to implement the concepts on their own. 


While I am not necessarily looking to recreate the perfect implementation of these concepts, I do take time to think through their implementation, validating each function with tests.
